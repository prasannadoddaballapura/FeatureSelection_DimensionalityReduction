# FeatureSelection_DimensionalityReduction

implemented the following clustering algorithms:
1. K-means
2. Expectation Maximization
In addition implemented the following feature dimensionality reduction algorithms
1. forward selection feature selection algorithm 
2. PCA
3. ICA
4. Randomized Projections

I have compared the performances of each of them with plots

Reproduced the clustering experiments on the datasets projected onto the new
spaces created by ICA, PCA and RP and answered the following quations like
did we get the same clusters as before o Different clusters?
Why? Why not? Compared and contrast the different algorithms
